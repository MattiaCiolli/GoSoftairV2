# GoSoftairV2
Enhanced version of the previous GoSoftair website developed with Java Enterprise, Tomcat and SQL Developer using the MVC pattern.
Used servlets and JSPs, models, filters, JDBC, services and external APIs like Google Maps, Facebook API and ilmeteo.net for weather forecasting.

It is possible to register/login normally or with Facebook. A registered user can insert announcements, create matches and edit his profile. He can also join matches choosing a team and view their details like weather, position on map, participants and leave comments.

With an https connection it's possible to follow in real time on the map the components of the own team and coordinate them sending some commands like "Attack", "Defend", "Stop".
