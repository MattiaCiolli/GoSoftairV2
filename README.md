# GoSoftairV2
Enhanced version of the previous GoSoftair website developed with Java Enterprise using the MVC pattern.
Used servlets, models, filters, JDBC, services and external APIs like Google Maps, Facebook API and ilmeteo.net.

It is possible to register/login normally or with Facebook. A registered user can insert announcements, create matches and edit his profile. He can also join matches and view their datails like weather, position on map, participants and leave comments.

Theme inspired by http://military.ancorathemes.com/
